QDO INICIA:
    - whatsapp web
    - git clone
    - make build
    - sudo nano /etc/hosts

WORDPRESS
    - https://demrodri.42.fr/wp-admin



FIXES
    - arrumar para usar o docker secrets;
    - qdo make fclean, nao apaga as pastas dentro de data/
    - nao esta criando o usuario demrodri no WordPress. Necessario?



FAZENDO
    - mudei Makefile para apagar tambem as pastas de /data
    - checando primeiro o Wordpress / http / https = ta dando ruim quando fclean e build
    fail no exec + nao ta copiando os arquivos pro data/wordpress ...
    testar mais uma vez do virgem (na 42 melhor teste)




CHANGES WHEN TESTING:

- sudo apk add docker-compose
- COMPOSE := doker-compose


HAD TO GO BACK, because of issues when make re
- create_dirs:
	@printf "Creating data directories...\n"
	@mkdir -p $(DATA_DIR)
	@sudo chmod -R 777 $(DATA_DIR)

- delete (dont need any more, folders are created by Docker)
    WORDPRESS_DATA_DIR := $(DATA_DIR)/wordpress
    MARIADB_DATA_DIR := $(DATA_DIR)/mariadb
    PORTAINER_DATA_DIR := $(DATA_DIR)/portainer

- make re: fclean build (just these two, as i was having issues with make re)





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

- remove the hifen between docker and compose in Makefile
- install docker-cli-compose
- insert sudo before grep in host_check

- the subject says no bind mounts!!!
- so, need to remove volumes from docker-compose.yml and create docker secrets for mariadb and wordpress
- also, need to remove the data folders creation from Makefile, because no bind mounts, so no need to create data folders

- need to create a script to initialize the wordpress database and user, because no bind mounts, so no way to copy the wp-config.php file to the data folder
- will do that using a docker-entrypoint-initdb.d script for mariadb, that will create the database and user for wordpress
- also, need to create a script to initialize the wordpress installation, because no bind mounts, so no way to copy the wp-config.php file to the data folder
- will do that using a docker-entrypoint-initdb.d script for wordpress, that will copy the wp-config.php file to the wordpress container

- need to check why Apache is being downloaded in FOREGROUND, when using docker-compose up -d
